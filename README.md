# Welcome to Modelab's site

It's built on Jekyll for static web generation from GIT ❤️

To run:

1. Install ruby > 2.6 (I strongly recommend using https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf to handle different versions).
2. `gem install bundler jekyll`
3. `jekyll s` to compile and serve through a web server on localhost:4000
